## Notice
Currently, Magento categories can not restored yet - this is included on the roadmap. Simple Products, Downloadable Products and Virtual Products are restored without issues. Other product types can also be restored, but their associative data (like the subproducts of Configurable Products) need to be reconfigured. Product images are saved to the media/trashcan folder.
